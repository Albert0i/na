## Forward
I have a story, i.e. **TA**, but I won't tell you, not because it is insignificant, just because I don't want to... Being stagnated in a pond for over two decades, I became so accustomed to the placid posture of it. The ways of gearing things up, the steps to do things right which I was so acquaintance. They just deeply implanted in my brain unconsciously. 

Two years ago, I came across the other *way* when I was finding means to *modernize* my artefacts. All my works proved to be in vain, as you may know, changing the clothes of a dying man doesn't prevent him from cessation, the only effect was to put a new shroud on old carcase... At the first sight of the *way*, I was startled and dropped to faint immediately at it's velocity and delicacy... With tremendous mental exertion, I managed to finish **TA2**.

While sitting miserably doesn't change anything. I decided to renounce my old ways, my old days and search for new dream, new deed, of course, with new way. 


## I. Back to HTTP, Back to Normal
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/">ASP.NET Web Forms</a> employs a simplified model to facilitate creation of web pages. The discussion of pros and cons is voluminous. The good things is it alleviates the burden of learning the underlay <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">HTTP</a> protocol, which gives novices a quick start. The bad things is, by default, you can not use HTTP verbs other than GET and POST<sup>[[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10906411/asp-net-web-api-put-delete-verbs-not-allowed-iis-8)</sup>and no intrinsic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTFul</a> URI support. 

HTTP verbs such as PUT and DELETE are important when <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp">AJAX</a> comes into play, RESTful URI are important when implementing API for front-end frameworks. While some strives to survive Web Forms in the Age of .NET 5/6+[[1]](https://blog.inedo.com/dotnet/net5-web-forms), others seek ways to migrate or even quit.
