Node-tify TA project 

## Forward
I have a story, i.e. **TA**, but I won't tell you, not because it is insignificant, just because I don't want to... Being stagnated in a pond for over two decades, I became so accustomed to the placid posture of it. The way of gearing things up, the steps to do things right I was so acquaintance with. They just deeply implanted in my brain. 

A few years ago, I came across other *way* when I was finding means to *modernize* my artefacts. All the works proved to be in vain, just like changing the clothes of a dying man doesn't prevent him from cessation, the only the effect was a new shroud to on old carcase. At the first sight, I was startled and dropped to faint immediately at the velocity and delicacy. After finishing **TA2**, I decided to abandon my old ways and old days.
