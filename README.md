Node-tify TA project 

## Forward
I have a story, i.e. **TA**, but I won't tell you, not because it is voluminous, just because I don't want to... Being stagnated in a pond for over two decades, I became so accustomed to the posture and temper ot it. The way of gearing up things, the conception, the steps to execute I was so acquaintance. They just deeply implanted in my brain. 

A few years ago, I came across other way when I was finding tools to *modernize* my artefacts. All my works proved in vain, changing the clothes of a dying man doesn't prevent him from cessation, the effect of a new shroud on old carcase. At the first sight, I was startled and dropped to faint immediately at the velocity and delicacy. A few months ago after finishing **TA2**, I decided to abandon my old days and ways.
